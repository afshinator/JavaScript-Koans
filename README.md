Time to meditate on the Koans!
======

A great way to re-introduce myself to a test-driven, check out a learning resouce, and make friends.
The assertions, and therefore exercise answers are in the /topics directory.

Thanks *https://github.com/liammclennan/JavaScript-Koans*, it was fun and quick.

JavaScript Koans is an interactive learning environment that uses failing tests to introduce students to aspects of JavaScript in a logical sequence.
